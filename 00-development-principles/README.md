# Development Principles

> "Principles are the foundation upon which great software is built."

---

## Overview

This section contains **core development principles** that guide how we think, design, and write code. These are not language-specific or framework-specific — they are **universal mindsets** that apply across all technologies.

Each principle follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview** - What is this principle?
2. **Why It Matters** - Problems it solves
3. **Core Concepts** - Key ideas and terminology
4. **Workflow & Checklist** - How to apply it
5. **Examples** - Good vs Bad code patterns
6. **References** - Further reading
